# What is version control?

It’s like appending a “2015-07-15-version-4-final-henrys-edits” to a filename but better.

--

# What is git?

It’s one of many version control systems. 

In particular, it’s a distributed version control system.

# What is GitHub?

Most simply it solves sharing. 

In theory everyone could push and pull from each other’s laptops but…
* hard to connect over the Internet to a laptop (might not be switched on or online)
* whose laptop is used by a server wanting a copy of the code


--

## What is GitHub?

But it’s so much more than that…
* open source software
* forks and pull requests
* organizations and collaborators
* history of changes
* wiki
* blog/website maker
* apps to make it easier to start working with git
* file editor
* and more: https://help.github.com/
