# What Is GitHub?

## It's a website: https://github.com

### What Is GitHub?

1. It’s a hub: it’s for sharing and collaborating.
2. It’s a hub based around the git version control system.

--

### That just begs more questions

1. What is version control?

### What is version control?

It’s like appending “2015-07-15-version-4-final-henrys-edits” to a filename before emailing it round.

--

### What is git?

It’s one of many version control systems. 

In particular, it’s a distributed version control system.

--

### What is GitHub?

Most simply it solves sharing.

In theory everyone could send and receive changes directly from each other’s laptops but…
* hard to connect over the Internet to a laptop (e.g. not switched on)
* how to ensure get everyone's changes?
* whose laptop is used by one of our servers?

--

### What is GitHub?

But it’s so much more than that…
* open source software
* forks and pull requests
* organizations and collaborators
* history of changes
* wiki
* blog/website maker
* apps to make it easier to start working with git
* file editor
* and more: https://help.github.com/
